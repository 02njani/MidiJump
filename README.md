# MIDI_Jump

MIDI Jump is a web-based 2D video game merging music and AI.  It presents an upward-scrolling platformer for two players, engaging them in friendly competition. The game features AI-generated background music and platforms that correspond to user-provided music notes, requiring Player 2 to navigate through them while Player 1 creates projectiles for Player 2 to dodge. I created this game with a team of four people.
